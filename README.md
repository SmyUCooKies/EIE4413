Aim to perform signal processing basics using **Python**, including FFT, filter design, signal filtering and visualizing.

## Lab 1: Spectrum Analysis and Linear Time-Invariant Systems

This lab explores the implementation of various fundamental concepts in signal processing using Python. The lab is divided into two parts:
1. DFT and FFT
2. Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Systems.

#### Part 1
- a. Comparing the computation time difference when data size is power of 2 or not.
- b. Visualizing the magnitude spectrum with different length N. Finding the frequency response at 900Hz with sampling frequency of 12800Hz.

#### Part 2
- a. Verifying **linear convolution** in the **time domain** is equivalent to the **point-by-point multiplication** in the **frequency domain**.
- b. Finding the computation time of #2a when data size is big with many zeros being padded.
- c. FFT with Overlap-and-Add method.
